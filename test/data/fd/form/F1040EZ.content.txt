Use this form 
if
• Your filing status is single or married filing jointly. If you are not sure about your filing status, see instructions. 
• You (and your spouse if married filing jointly) were under age 65 and not blind at the end of 2013. If you were born on 
January 1, 1949, you are considered to be age 65 at the end of 2013.
• You do not claim any dependents. For information on dependents, see Pub. 501. 
• Your taxable income (line 6) is less than $100,000. 
• You do not claim any adjustments to income. For information on adjustments to income, use the TeleTax topics listed under 
Adjustments to Income
 at 
www.irs.gov/taxtopics
 (see instructions).
• The only tax credit you can claim is the earned income credit (EIC). The credit may give you a refund even if you do not owe 
any tax. You do not need a qualifying child to claim the EIC. For information on credits, use the TeleTax topics listed under 
Tax Credits
 at 
www.irs.gov/taxtopics
 (see instructions). If you received a Form 1098-T or paid higher education expenses, you 
may be eligible for a tax credit or deduction that you must claim on Form 1040A or Form 1040. For more information on tax 
benefits for education, see Pub. 970. 
• You had only wages, salaries, tips, taxable scholarship or fellowship grants, unemployment compensation, or Alaska 
Permanent Fund dividends, and your taxable interest was not over $1,500. But if you earned tips, including allocated tips, that
 
are not included in box 5 and box 7 of your Form W-2, you may not be able to use Form 1040EZ (see instructions). If you are 
planning to use Form 1040EZ for a child who received Alaska Permanent Fund dividends, see instructions.
Filling in your 
return
If you received a scholarship or fellowship grant or tax-exempt interest income, such as on municipal bonds, see the 
instructions before filling in the form. Also, see the instructions if you received a Form 1099-INT showing federal income tax 
withheld or if federal income tax was withheld from your unemployment compensation or Alaska Permanent Fund dividends.
For tips on 
how to avoid 
common 
mistakes, see 
instructions.
Remember, you must report all wages, salaries, and tips even if you do not get a Form W-2 from your employer. You must also 
report all your taxable interest, including interest from banks, savings and loans, credit unions, etc., even if you do not get
 a 
Form 1099-INT.
